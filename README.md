# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
## Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the development , operation an maintenance of software.

## What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering differs from traditional programming where by traditional programming is used to developer simeple softwares whereas software engineering is used to develop complex software solutions


# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
## Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Requirement phase - gathering and analyzing data
design phase - creating a desing for the software besed on the requirements
Implementation phase - writing the code for the software 
testing phase - testing of the software which rane from unit testing system        testing and acceptance testing
deployment phase - releasing the software to the production environment
maintenance phase - ensuring the software remains functinal by fixing errors and proving updates to the softwares

# Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
## Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile method is mostly used for project where it is required to evolve while the waterfront method id prefered for projects with well-defiend and table requirements

the main difference between agile and waterfall methods is in waterfall for the next step to start the step before must be complete wile for agile development is done in sprints




# Requirements Engineering:
## What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is the process fof maintaining , defining and documenting requiremensts fo a software system. The process includes 
Elicitation, Analysis Specification Validation Management and the importance of requirement engineering is helps in reducign risk of project failure 


# Software Design Principles:
## Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Concept of odularity is whre each module has a specific reposnibility and can be developed and mainteined independently and it improves maintainaility and scalability by making the modules reusable , making it easier t o update and fix issues.

# Testing in Software Engineering:
## Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing - is testing the functions and making sure each and every part of te code works as intended

Integration testing - is testing the integrated modules

System testing - is testing the complete and integrated software system 

Acceptance testing  is testing that validates that the software eets the business requirements


the importance of testing is to make sure that the software functions correctly and meets the requirments

# Version Control Systems:
## What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are systems that help to track the lifecycle of project and also allows developers to collaborate  and some examples are git, subversion and mercurial

# Software Project Management:
## Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
some of the role of the software project manager are planning , recommunication, risk management and some challenges include managing changes , balancing cost  time and coordinating and motivating a diverse team


# Software Maintenance:
## Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software to improve perfomance  and its importance is it keeps the software functional and relevant as new technologies are introduced and can also be incoporated  
type of maintenance include:
adaptive , preventive perfective and corrective maintenance

# Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
## What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
some ethical issues include:
transparency , privacy and data security, intellectual property 

some ways to adhering to ethial standards include:
having code of ethics
